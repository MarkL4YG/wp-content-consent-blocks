# WP content consent blocks

_This is not an official Wordpress plugin nor is it officially endorsed by Wordpress or affiliated companies._

__WP content consent blocks__ is a plugin for Wordpress which allows some content of the site to be hidden until the viewer gives their explicit consent to show the content.

## Why this plugin?

European law requires site owners to explicitly ask their users for consent before their data is tracked.
This mainly affects any sort of embedded content from third party services as the site owner has no direct control on what the third party does with the received user data.

This plugin was build to optionally embed social media feeds into Wordpress sites.
Viewers are informed about what content is about to be shown and why their consent is required to show the content (content disclaimer).
If the viewer decides to accept the disclaimer, the content is shown and the viewer can interact with it.

## Blocks added by the plugin
